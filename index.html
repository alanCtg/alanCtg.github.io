		<h1>Alan's Portfolio</h1>
		<p>This portfolio showcases a collection of projects I have undertaken during my academic pursuits 
		and my personal time. A significant portion of my work has been developed using the 
		<A HREF="https://processing.org/">Processing</A> software tool, a versatile platform akin to p5.js. 
		Furthermore, I have recently transitioned to using Unity platform for my upcoming personal projects.</p>
		
		<p>This website serves as a valuable platform for me to expose myself to web development while working
		as a full-time DevOps engineer. Despite my limited experience in front-end development, I am proactively  
		using this opportunity to gain invaluable exposure. Simultaneously, I am applying a range of release and 
		source control best practices to ensure the seamless deployment of changes to production via this website.
		Additionally, this endeavor showcases my ability to swiftly acquire and apply front-end development skills,
		reaffirming my versatility as a developer.</p>
		
		<p>With all that being said, I invite you to explore my portfolio via the buttons below.</p>
