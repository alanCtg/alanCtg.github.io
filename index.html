		<h1>Alan's Portfolio</h1>
		<p>This portfolio showcases a collection of projects I have undertaken during my academic pursuits 
		and my personal time. A significant portion of my work has been developed using the 
		<A HREF="https://processing.org/">Processing</A> software tool, a versatile platform akin to p5.js. 
		Furthermore, I have recently transitioned to using Unity platform for my upcoming personal projects</p>
